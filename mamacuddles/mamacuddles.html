            KRIASH is a medical startup founded by Dr. Neetika Ashwani. It aims
            to support the bond between parents and their infants through skin
            to skin care (SSC), the simple act of an adult holding an infant to
            their chest and maintaining skin contact. To this end they have
            developed the MamaCuddles band and patch devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            In just three weeks we delivered a comprehensive, testable prototype
            for the MamaCuddles device, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Branding and visual design</li>
            <li>6 full features + an onboarding flow</li>
            <li>Qualitative user research and competitive analysis</li>

          <h2>What is MamaCuddles?</h2>
          <div class="line"></div>
        </div>
        <p>
          MamaCuddles is a non invasive, wireless sensor bracelet and patch set
          that offer continuous monitoring of infant vitals while tracking Skin
          to Skin Care (SSC). KRIASH prioritizes SSC because of evidence that
          shows that SSC provides a number of benefits to infants: the
          bolstering of growth and brain development, improved quality of life
          and reduced disease burden. It’s more commonly understood that SSC is
          important for babies born prematurely, but those health benefits
          largely extend to full term babies as well–and some even to adults
          (e.g. release of oxytocin, feeling of bonding, etc.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Our core deliverable was a design for a parent-facing mobile app that
          interfaces with the MamaCuddles device to provide real time feedback
          on the health and wellness of both parent and child.

            To start, our team needed to get a better understanding of the
            infant-monitoring-device market (which sounds more niche than it
            is). By conducting a feature inventory, we learned that while other
            monitoring apps tracked vitals like heartrate or blood oxygen, none
            tracked SSC hours. We took some lessons from existing baby
            monitoring products like Neebo, Owlet, and Ovia–as well as from
            comparators like period tracking and glucose monitoring apps.

          <h2>User Discovery and Interviews</h2>
          <div class="line"></div>
        </div>
        <p>
          We interviewed 12 parents, most of whom have had children within the
          past 10 years. Through this practice we wanted to find out more about
          our users and better understand:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            what parents felt and experienced when their children were young
            infants.
          </li>
          <li>
            how people were using apps to track different aspects of their
            lives.
          </li>
          <li>
            the kinds of unexpected needs or more uncommon situations that arise
            in a parent’s life, and what we could do to mitigate them.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is what folks were saying:</p>
        <div class="image"><img src="mc-quotes.png" /></div>
        <p>After synthesizing those interviews we arrived at some findings:</p>
        <div class="image"><img src="mc-key-research-findings.png" /></div>

          <h2>User Flows and Personas</h2>
          <div class="line"></div>
        </div>
        <p>
          This prospective flow illustrates the fear, confusion, and anxiety
          that parents feel during the birthing and childcare experience.
        </p>
        <div class="image"><img src="mc-user-flow.png" /></div>
        <p>We then built some personas that speak to this unique experience.</p>
        <div class="image"><img src="mc-fiona.png" /></div>
        <div class="image"><img src="mc-peter.png" /></div>
        <p>
          Our problem statement centers around Fiona the full-term mother, who
          also happens to be our primary persona. This is because MamaCuddles is
          a direct-to-consumer product with an at-home use case and parents with
          full-term babies would represent a majority of the user base. Premie
          parents are already well-aware of the benefits of SSC–but among
          fullterm parents that knowledge is less common, and actually tracking
          SSC is even less so. We landed on this problem statement that would
          guide our design ideation:

        <p>
          Finally, in order to ensure we’re keeping our problem in mind as well
          ideate substantive solutions, the team generated How-Might-We
          statements that explore potential solution paths. These 4 HMWs ended
          up as the genesis of the main features and functionality of the app.
