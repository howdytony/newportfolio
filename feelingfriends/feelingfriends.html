        <p>
          Feeling Friends was originally built in three days in response to the theme of Accessibility
          for General Assembly’s 2023 Mini-Hackathon (and took home Fan Favorite!). We landed on an
          idea for a emotion identification tool and activity set that would help students recognize
          and take ownership of their emotions–particularly those with additional barriers to
          regulation such as Autism and ADHD. Our team continued to develop the app further to improve
          it's usability and function.

        A report published in the National Library of Medicine studied over 300 kindergarteners and
        found that their ability to manage emotions had a positive correlation with academic success
        and relationship building.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Positive Association with Academic Success:</b> This includes better productivity in the
          classroom and higher standardized early literacy and math achievement scores​.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Independent of Cognitive Ability:</b> The study noted that even after accounting for IQ,
          emotion regulation, along with the quality of the student-teacher relationship, uniquely
          predicted academic outcomes. This suggests that emotion regulation plays a crucial role in
          academic success beyond cognitive abilities alone​.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Development of Positive Relationships and Cognitive Processes:</b> Emotion regulation
          skills were found to facilitate the development of positive student-teacher relationships
          and support cognitive processing and independent learning behaviors. These factors are
          important for maintaining academic motivation and success​.

          To make the task of identifying emotions fun for students, we developed the Feeling
            Friends: charming creature companions that would accompany students through the flow. 
            The character's exaggerated expressions make it easier to identify their emotions, while their 
            rounded shapes and cheerful colors help keep the process upbeat and positive – particularly 
            for emotions like fear, anger, or sadness.  </p>

        <h2>Student Daily Check-In</h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
      </div>
      <p>
        As the core of Feeling Friends, the daily check-in captures and records the emotion and Zone
        of Regulation (ZoR) of each student in the class through a brief, self-directed flow. At the
        end of the check-in we deliver a coping skill activity geared toward engaging with the choosen
        emotion. Practicing identifiying their emotions and regulatory zones by themselves builds
        confidence and makes big emotions less scary.
      </p>
  <div class="horizontalsection">
        <p>
          <b>Feeling Feelings</b><br>
          Students select an emotion that brances off of one of six core umbrellas: 
          pride, happiness, fear, sadness, anxiety, and anger. Expressive characters model the feelings to help kids pick the right one. </p>

        <p>
          <b>Mind and Body Connection</b> <br>
          Once they've checked in with their brains, students then decide how their body is feeling! 
            These "Regulatory Zones" range from highly stimulated (explosive) to lack of stimulation (unmotivated).
            The addition of zones allows for a wider range of student expression, 
            and helps the teacher get a more nuanced picture of the state of their class.

      <div class="horizontalsection"> 
          <p>
          <b>Identifying Goals and Needs</b> <br>
          Students set achievable, daily benchmarks for themselves and are able to ask for help in a private, 
          quiet way. These are customizable and can be unique across classes.

        <b>Coping Strategy Cards</b> <br/>
        These provide guided activities for development and continued learning that are delivered at
        the end of the flow.

      <p><b>Class Dashboard</b><br>
      Teachers logging in will be greeted with a list that displays their class's info and provides a summary of the most recent capture

      <div class="image"><img style="max-width:100% !important;" src="classlistataglance.png"></div>
      </div>
      <p><b>Classroom View</b><br>
        Both room and list views are color-coded according to the student ZoR, based on the class’s most recent
        check-in. This allows for an at-a-glance understanding of the class’s general temperament. Teachers can 
        set and arrange the classroom's students and objects into a custom seating chart, or use the list view to 
        easily find student using filters.  </p>

        <p>
          The teacher can also manage their classroom
        roster, see a comprehensive history of students’ moods and regulatory zones over time, and
        even attach IEPs (Individualized Education Programs) to student profiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        The teacher flow is responsive from desktop to mobile, so teachers can quickly check on their
        classes from their phones, or sit down at their computer to manage seating charts.
