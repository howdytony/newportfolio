          <p>
            Gethsemane Garden Center has been a beloved institution of Chicago's
            Andersonville neighborhood since 1977—but its web presence has
            lagged a bit behind the times. Slow load times, clunky navigation,
            no real search, and enough text to make your eyes glaze over.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal: bring the site up to speed with the business it represents.
            I restructured the site's information architecture, redesigned its
            interface, fine-tuned performance, and added search functionality.
            Six months later: gift certificate sales were up 15% (a reliable,
            core sales metric for the business), site traffic was growing, and
            customers were finally saying, “This feels like Gethsemane.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Behind the scenes, we untangled WordPress plugin bloat, streamlined
            for mobile, and introduced a fresh brand voice that is equal parts
            expert and neighborly. Here’s how we went from
            <strong>“Whoa, that’s a lot of information…”</strong> to
            <strong>“I found exactly what I needed in seconds.”</strong>

          <h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
          <div class="line"></div>
        </div>
        <p>
          When I first met with the owner and marketing manager (who doubled as
          the webmaster), their website felt like an afterthought—pages loaded
          in 3+ seconds, labels like "GC home" or “Edibles” left users
          scratching their heads, and there was no usable search.
          <br /><br />
          User testing confirmed these hunches:
        </p>
        <img src="./geth-user-quotes-before.png" />

        <p>Here's what else I learned from user testing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            There’s an overwhelming amount of text—no way to scan or find what
            users came for.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users wanted clear examples (“What plants do you actually sell? How
            easy are they to care for?”).
          </li>
          <li>
            Social media feeds felt random—users loved the imagery but didn’t
            know why it was there.
          </li>
          <li>
            Clickable elements weren’t obvious—some images looked tappable but
            weren’t, and mobile links weren’t highlighted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Email newsletter calls-to-action lacked context—no incentive to sign
            up.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users craved images of the physical space and product offerings (“Is
            that the poinsettia I’d get?”).
          </li>
          <li>
            They’d skip navigation entirely if a reliable search could get them
            to the right page faster.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In short: Gethsemane’s website didn’t reflect its community warmth or
          make it easy to buy gift certificates (a core, stable offering). We
          needed to fix that—fast.

        </div>
        <p>
          Before sketching anything, I dove into research to avoid guesswork.
          Since no analytics existed, I set up basic visitor and search tracking
          and ran a full heuristic evaluation. Then I conducted:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>User Interviews &amp; Testing</strong> (10 participants,
            avg. age 35; skews female 50+). We observed frustration with reading
            huge blocks of text and unclear navigation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Card Sorting</strong> to uncover how people think about
            plant categories. Our findings led to a new hierarchy: people expect
            “Herbs &amp; Veg” rather than “Edibles,” “Houseplants” rather than
            “Greenhouse.” and "Home Decor" over "GC Home".
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Competitive &amp; Heuristic Analysis</strong> of five
            local/national garden retailers. They all featured clear product
            pages, FAQs that mapped to top customer questions, consistent visual
            branding—and a search bar that actually worked.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <em
            >Visual Placeholder: Excerpt from card-sort results and competitive
            analysis matrix</em
          >
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            People want to see “What you carry” before “How to care for it.”
          </li>
          <li>
            Labeling must match everyday language (e.g., “Home Décor” instead of
            “GC Home”).
          </li>
          <li>
            Mobile experience was non-existent—users bounced when they saw walls
            of text that didn’t fit their screens.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users would abandon navigation if search were reliable, so we needed
            to fix search first.
          </li>
          <li>
            Since e-commerce potential is limited, we needed to spotlight
            workshop and gift certificate purchases (a stable revenue stream) up
            front.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        </div>
        <p>
          Armed with those insights, I sketched a plan to reorganize content,
          redesign visuals, implement a robust search, and optimize
          performance—while celebrating that signature pansy mascot and
          Andersonville charm. Here’s how:
        </p>

        <div class="container">

            <div class="line"></div>
          </div>
          <p>
            The biggest win: improving content scannability and organizing it to
            more closely match user mental models, as well as providing
            alternative paths to content. In practice, this meant:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Introduced consistent hierarchy of scale across all pages,
              including clear section headers and labels to make scanning a
              breeze.
            </li>
            <li>
              Introduced "FAQ" and "Services" pages, common ways users might try
              to figure out if we deliver, or whether we offer garden design
              services.
            </li>
            <li>
              Removed one long “Resources” page; shifted plant-care guides into
              the relevant department pages.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div

            Next, we needed a look and feel that felt both trustworthy and
            fun—just like Gethsemane in person. This ended up being part of a
            larger branding overhaul
            <a href="../gethsemane/gethsemane-brand.html"

                Since our users were eager to bypass navigation, we reintroduced

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Built a custom search query that prioritized product pages,

                </li>
                <li>
                  Filtered out irrelevant content (e.g., archived blog posts) so

                <li>

            <li>
              Implemented responsive design: flexible grids and breakpoints to

            </li>
            <li>
              Optimized images to WebP format, added lazy loading, and minified

              paint.
            </li>

              Worked around WordPress constraints: deactivated heavy plugins,

          Between August and October 2024, we moved from “What is this site
          even?” to “I found it instantly!”—all while keeping a tight budget
          (under $150 for a staging plugin). Here’s what happened after launch:

            - <strong>Gift Certificate Sales:</strong> +15% in the first six
            months (compared November 2023–May 2024 vs. November 2024–May
            2025).<br />
            - <strong>Overall Web Traffic:</strong> +30% year over year, driven
            by better SEO (added descriptive metadata and alt tags) and faster
            load times.<br />
            - <strong>Load Time Reduction:</strong> From 3.2s to 1.8s on average
            (mobile and desktop, per Lighthouse reports).<br />
            - <strong>Search Usage:</strong> 20% of users bypassed navigation
            entirely and found relevant pages via search within five seconds.

        <p>This project reinforced a few guiding principles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Business Alignment Is Everything:</strong> By spotlighting
            gift certificates and workshops—where e-commerce dollars truly
            flowed—we maximized impact with minimal dev constraints.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Content First, Style Second:</strong> Organizing IA unlocked
            all the visual and performance wins. Clarity always beats
            cleverness.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Search as a Lifeline:</strong> A reliable search bar boosts
            usability dramatically—users will skip navigation if they can type
            and go.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>WordPress Realities:</strong> Ecosystem plugins can be
            powerful but can also slow you down. We learned to pick lightweight
            alternatives and consolidate custom code where possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Plan for Iteration:</strong> Gethsemane’s needs will evolve
            seasonally. We built a foundation that’s flexible: update workshop
            dates easily, swap seasonal photography, and add new event pages
            without a full redesign.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Next on the roadmap: adding short video tours of the greenhouse,
          integrating Instagram stories with proper context, and launching a
          community Q&amp;A feature for plant-care questions.
