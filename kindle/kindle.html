              Through user research we developed Kindle Book Club as a way to bring readers together on

          <h2>Background and Goals</h2>
          <div class="line"></div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Amazon’s company vision for Kindle is “to make available in less than 60 seconds every book,
          ever written, in any language, in print or out of print." The Kindle device is an eReader that
          uses e-Ink technology. Its primary function is reading, though some models feature more
          tablet-like functionality.<br /><br />
          There are 30 million active users in the US alone, with 5x that sold globally (adoption in
          China is on the rise: 26.1% of Chinese people–around 365 million individuals–have read an
          ebook over the past year, compared to 23% of the US, it might be worth conducting testing of
          this feature in the Chinese market).<br /><br />
          People connect to their communities at large through sharing stories with each other. We
          wanted to more deeply understand this connection so that we could leverage what we learn in
          service of Kindle’s mission. Keeping that in mind, our team developed some goals:
        </p>
        <div class="image"><img src="kindle-goals.png"></div>
      </div>
    
      <div class="container">
        <div class="sectiontitle">
          <h2>Research Synthesis</h2>
          <div class="line"></div>
        </div>
        <p>
          First things first–we need to figure some things out. We began research with competitive and
          comparative analysis to get a better sense of the eReading industry. We took a feature
          inventory of eReader devices, as well as other book club hosting sites or sites like Meetup
          that allow users to create online groups that meet virtually or in person.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Feature and Competitive/Comparative Analysis</b> <br />
          We learned that no competing devices in the e-reading space let you have conversations with
          others within the text of the book itself, and e-reading platforms offered very little
          functionality specific to club organization, like scheduling meetings or setting group goals.
          (Book clubbers we talked to turned to sites like Goodreads or Bookclubs.com to fulfill their
          club management needs)
          </p>
          <div class="image"><img src="feature-analysis-chart.png"></div>
        <p>
          Through this process we realized that we would need to be prepared to solve for Kindle’s
          app/website or for the Kindle device itself. Knowing this, I began to study Kindle’s design
          conventions by recreating screens from the device in order to better understand how pages were
          constructed. 
          </br></br>
          Ultimately, these constraints were a big reason why we decided to design for the
          Kindle device itself rather than the Kindle app or desktop site. If we design for the
          simplest, least powerful hardware then our design should be easy to port to another
          platform. This led to some technical parameters that we could use later on in our solution:
        </p>
        <div class="image"><img src="tech-specs.png"></div>
        <p>
          <b>User Interviews</b> <br />
          Next, we needed to talk to some folks to understand how people are reading and book-clubbing
          currently. We conducted 13 user interviews which revealed some common topics of interest:
        </p>
        <div class="caption">
          <p><b>1. Need for and difficulty in regular meeting times:</b> </p>
          <div class="image"><img src="kindlequote1.png"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="horizontalsection">
        <div class="caption">
          <p><b>2. Impulse to elevate group discussion and expand it beyond scheduled meeting time:</b> </p>

        </div>
        <div class="caption">

          <div class="image"><img src="kindlequote3.png"></div>
        </div>
        </div>
        <div class="caption">
          <p><b>4. Love of reading and desire to share the lessons taught by books:</b> </p>
          <div class="image"><img src="kindlequote4.png"></div>
        </div>
      </div>
    
      <div class="container">
        <div class="sectiontitle">
          <h2>Defining the Problem</h2>
          <div class="line"></div>
        </div>
        <p>
        Let’s sum things up a little, shall we?
        </p>
        <div class="image"><img src="key-research-findings.png"></div>
    
        <p>
          <b>Building Personas</b> <br />
          Using the results of our research we developed some personas–fictional people who represent a
          very real group of users. Our team wanted them to feel nuanced enough to accurately represent
          a believable user, while making their pain points and goals broad enough to ideate a solution
          that solves for a lot of different users.
          </br>Though this process we were able to nail down more
          clearly which pain points we could solve most effectively while keeping the requirements of
          the brief in mind. We landed on club scheduling/management, seamless integration into daily
          life, and keeping engagement high between official club meetings as important topics. These
          are the resulting personas:
        </p>
        <div class="image"><img src="persona-paulo.png"></div>
        <div class="image"><img src="persona-venn-diagram.png"></div>
        <div class="image"><img src="persona-bea.png"></div>
        <p>
          <b>So what's the problem?</b> <br/>
          We synthesized our interview data into something more meaningful for our research. We did this
          by grouping quotes and tidbits from our interviews into topic groups that were represented by
          "I statements". This helped to clarify our research topics and understand what pain points and
          goals came up the most often for our users. We isolated three main takeaways.
          </p>
        <div class="image"><img src="research-takeaways.png"></div>
    <p>We acknowledged those findings in our final problem statement.</p>
        <div class="image"><img src="kindle-problem-statement.png"></div>
      </div>
    
    
        <div class="container">
        <div class="sectiontitle">
          <h2>Designing the Solution</h2>
          <div class="line"></div>
        </div>
        <p>
          We revealed paths to possible solutions by writing “How might we...” questions. These allow
          for quick ideation while remembering our person’s needs, goals, and frustrations.
        </p>
        <b>How might we...</b>
        <div class="horizontalsection">
          <div class="image"><img src="kindle-hmw01.png"></div>

          <div class="image"><img src="kindle-hmw04.png"></div>
        </div>
        <p>
          From here it was just a matter of translating those ‘How Might We’s’ into user flows for
          relevant tasks.
        </p>
        <b>Flows for user tasks</b>
        <div class="caption">
          <p><b>1. Linking an existing bookclub </b> </p>

        </div>
    
        <p>
          Keeping in mind the research and design constraints we found thus far, we developed our solution, Kindle Book Club.
          Without further ado...
        </p>
        <div class="image"><img src="introducing-kindlebookclub.png"></div>

          <h2>Bookclub Features</h2>
          <div class="line"></div>
        </div>
        <p><b>Inline annotation & discussion</b><br/>
          This feature allows users to continue having exciting discussion in-between club
          meetings–while never having to leave the text of the book! We expanded on Kindle’s existing
          note taking capability by adding the ability for users to respond to annotations in a thread.
          </p>
          <div class="image"><img src="inlineannotation.png"></div>
          
          <p><b>Book progess & activity bar</b><br/>
          In an effort to keep excitement for reading high, we added an activity bar to Kindle’s native
          book progress bar. This bar tells the user where they are in the book and how much is left.
          Adding a visual cue as to the relative activity in a certain book section gets readers excited
          about what juicy discussion is happening in the part that they haven’t gotten to yet!
          </p>
          <div class="image"><img src="progress-bar-section.png"></div>
      
          <div class="horizontalsection">
          <p><b>Achievements & goals</b><br/>
          Who doesn't like a challenge? Achievements and goals can be used to push group members to read just a few pages more, with the potential for incentives in the form of book discounts or other rewards.
          </p>

          <h2>Testing and Conclusions</h2>
          <div class="line"></div>
        </div>
        <p> In order to get a sense of how the prototype was working, we conducted seven usability
          tests. We found that a majority of them could complete tasks like linking their club, making a
          note and replying to a fellow club member’s note without error. 
          <br /><br />
          However, we noticed that users struggled with understanding and finding the book progress and
          activity bar. If you recall, the bar looks something like this: </p>
          <div class="image"><img src="book-progress-bar.png"></div>
          <p>What does it all mean?!
              We added some checkbox toggles that indicate which group is responsible for the 
              activity level shown. We hadn’t initially included these toggles and users were confused 
              about exactly what metrics the bar was communicating. We went ahead and made this change 
              to help alleviate some of that confusion, particularly as this is a large addition that we 
              made to Kindle’s existing UI.</p>
